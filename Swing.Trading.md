**Retailer**
Those group of people who buy or sell stock in little volume in the hope of making some profit from share market and some time can be influence.

Let me show you how you can catch when the operator entered the market and leaved the market. If you can move along with them, then there is a high change that you 
make money with them or minimize the risk of loss.

BULLISH Trend.  And we should grab this opportunity and enter the market.
